# AI project methodology - Credit score prediction 📊
### Team members 👥
- Sergio Morales
- Isaac Gonzales

## Use case 🛠
In this case, we are analysing and reviewing the dataset presented in the Kaggle challenge of [Credit Score Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasy46/credit-score-prediction). </br>
The idea is to calculate the credit score of an specific user (customer) given different important fields like the monthly income, the number of credits inquired, or the amount invested monthly among others.

## Set up 💻
Create and activate to get all the dependencies a new virtual environment using `conda` or `miniforge`. 
```
$ conda env create -f conda.yaml
$ conda activate cred-score
```
To finish the setup of our packages, go to the folder `credit-score` 📁 and run the following command _(This is a local package, and therefore, it should be installed manually)_:
```
$ pip install .
```

_To deactivate an active environment, use_
```
$ conda deactivate
```
